# WhatNeedsBe
### Trello-inspired task tracker.

### MVP
A simple list of tasks.
1) Right now, just a simple CRUD app for tasks
    - Create
    - Read
    - Update
    - Delete
2) Due dates
3) Linking tasks
5) Task groups within categories (possibly allow dragging)
4) Divide tasks into categories: life, game dev, etc.

### Nice to haves
- Users
- Descriptions like Trello where it shows an icon if there is one, but doesn't bug you to add one.

### Notes
- Missing due date marks task as failed.
- Tasks can be assigned a completion state at any time.
- Most common states as buttons for easy select, dropdown for other states.
- Dropdown button on the task for editing instead of navigating to its own page. Description length might be a problem.
